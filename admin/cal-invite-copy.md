Open Source Friday âœ¨ is a place for maintainers to share what they are working on. This is an opportunity to share demos, stories, and inspiration with other GitHub users.

The stream will be hosted on stream yard, but broadcasted out to our viewers on Twitch, Linkedin and Youtube. The recording will also be uploaded to GitHub's Youtube Channel.   

Start time for the stream will be 1:00 pm ET. 
We meet at 12:45pm ET for prep and tech checks.

Here is a recording guide for streaming remotely.
